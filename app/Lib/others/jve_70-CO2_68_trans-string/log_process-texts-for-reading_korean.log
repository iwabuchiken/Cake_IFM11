In a recent Newsweek piece, Tom Oâ€™Connor confirms that â€œthe Syrian president has not only survived but appears poised to make a stunning comeback on the world stage.â€ Oâ€™Connor elaborates: â€œRecognizing reality, many of the countries that cut him [Assad] off 10 years ago have begun to welcome him back, despite ongoing US opposition to his rule. Telltale signs: Just last month, Jordan reopened its border with Syria, and the Arab League is widely expected to reinstate its membership shortly.â€

Though Moscow has played a major role in the conflict in Syria since the end of September 2015, its support has come at a price - one which suggests that its status has been less that of an ally and more that of putative imperial overlord. With this in mind, consider the words of former Russian diplomat, Alexander Aksenyonok, as quoted in May 2020 article by veteran Middle East correspondent Martin Jay from May: â€œIf Assad refuses to accept a new constitution, the Syrian regime will put itself at great risk.â€

match : line -->With the collapse of the PRGâ€™s socialist experiment, Grenada was thrown head first into the neoliberal era and a debt crisis, resulting in multiple rounds of structural adjustment that would eviscerate public spending and gut already-meagre social support networks. Similar to other Caribbean states, the government in Grenada is the predominant employer. When it was forced, through structural adjustment policies, to sell off public assets, structural, long term unemployment was the inevitable result. Emigration has since become characteristic of the island, as 71 percent of its secondary school and 85 percent of tertiary graduates have left the island. Not surprisingly the size of the Grenadian diaspora is estimated to be larger than the domestic population of 110,000 people.

match : line -->The Macron Doctrine, or the Paris Consensus, pledges to reverse those trends. To fight back against the ills of the financialised economy, Macron offers a three-pillar solution: more Europe, a true Europe-Africa partnership, and coalitions with governments and non-governmental players. Indeed, the Macron Doctrine is notionally post-colonial.  It calls for re-inventing the â€˜Afro-European Axisâ€™ and puts the onus on Europeans to â€˜show that this universalism we uphold is not universalism of the dominant, as it was during colonisation, but one of friends and partnersâ€™. If the Macron Doctrine for Europe is to make it â€˜the leading power in education, health, digital and green policiesâ€™ with massive investments, by extension it promises a post-financialisation, post-colonial partnership with Africa.

match : line -->For the last decade, the G20, the IMF, the World Bank and other multilateral development banks, (including the African Development Bank), and national development agencies (including the French Development Agency, the AFD) have pursued a new development agenda focused on a â€œgrand bargainâ€ with private finance: the Wall Street Consensus. Its logic is powerful. The global portfolio glut â€“ the trillions managed by institutional investors, mostly from the Global North â€“ could finance the Sustainable Development Goals, given the assumption of scarce public resources in the Global South. For instance, the World Bankâ€™s Maximising  Finance for Development agenda, introduced in 2017, promises institutional investors $12 trillion in market opportunities in the â€œWHITE sectorsâ€ â€“ Welfare, Health, Infrastructure, Transportation, Education. But institutional investors are governed by specific investment rules that need to be accommodated if they are to finance development. The urgent development question then becomes: how to â€˜escortâ€™ institutional investors (pension funds, insurance companies, investment funds) and their asset managers towards these opportunities?

This logic, neatly outlined by the Inter-American Development Bank, is echoed by all other multilateral development banks. It signals that the Wall Street Consensus is a project to reduce direct public investments in, and public delivery of services, and instead shift them to the private sector. The wrapping of the Washington Consensus privatisation agenda has changed, but the substance remains the same: citizens pay user fees for public services, now built and delivered via public-private partnerships (PPPs).

match : line -->When the state assumes demand risks, it guarantees PPP investors a pre-agreed level of revenue, regardless of actual demand for the public service. Examples abound. When Kenyaâ€™s President, Uhuru Kenyatta, visited Macron in October 2020, the local Kenyan newspapers reported  this as an official visit to conclude several PPP agreements in water, energy and transport. One of these PPPs, the Nairobi-Nakuru-Mau toll highway, will be constructed, financed and managed for 30 years by a consortium led by the French construction company Vinci and the French Asset Manager Meridiam fund. The Kenyan government guarantees â€˜availability of trafficâ€™ through a Toll Fund, approved by the Kenyan Parliament before Kenyattaâ€™s trip to France. The Toll Fund compensates the private French consortium should Kenyan citizens and firms fail to generate sufficient toll revenue. Kenyans pay, either directly through the toll tax, or indirectly through taxes, via the Toll Fund. The Toll Fund is a fiscal instrument for â€˜deriskingâ€™ French investments in Kenyan infrastructure.

Take the French asset manager Meridiam, one of the first  Strategic Partners of the General Secretary for the 2020 Africa-France Summit (postponed to next year due to the pandemic). Its Meridiam Infrastructure Africa fund, with over EUR 500 million in assets, includes a hospital in Ivory Coast, toll highways in Kenya, and renewable energy projects in Senegal, Ethiopia, Nigeria and Ivory Coast, run as PPP projects. Its CEO, Thierry Deau, recently applauded  a â€˜major cultural shift towards a broader derisking philosophyâ€™ to achieve the UN Sustainable Development Goals, and noted that the success of its Africa infrastructure fund in part reflected its ability to create strategic partnerships with African governments so that : â€œwe benefit in the contract with the authorities from a strong currency risk protection reinforced by a political risk insurance coverage in case the government does not meet its commitment.  Eventually, this provides a very robust protection.â€

match : line -->Empathy, the ability to understand and share the feelings of other beings, is present in some form in most living things on Earth. Scientists theorize that empathy developed as an evolutionary strategy to build stronger bonds among animals that depend on cooperation for survival. In one particular kind of animal, humans, empathy is clear evidence that the claim spread by the ruling class, that each of us is fundamentally cruel, self-interested, and greedy is nothing more than an attempt to naturalize the individualism and antisocial behavior that best serves their exploitative interests. In its purest form empathy is a net positive for us on a planet where for the last several hundred years the genocidal system of capitalism-imperialism has normalized massive daily violence happening against a backdrop of apathy and ignorance. Empathyâ€™s endurance among us says that a better and more just way of living is possible despite our current conditions and that the (re)building of that way of living is within our capacity. However, empathy, like almost every aspect of the psyche when we are disorganized and unconscious, can be weaponized and manipulated by that same genocidal global system. We are witnessing this today on a grand scale.

Masses of people outside of the so-called â€œLeftâ€, people who had never understood themselves to be activists or particularly interested in social justice at all, were motivated to mobilize and take action to protest what they correctly understood as openly cruel policies and practices. We saw massive demonstrations at airports halting deportation flights, impassioned monologues from late night talk show hosts, breathless media coverage, undercover exposÃ©s, presidential candidates denouncing â€˜kids in cagesâ€™, and members of the progressive Democratic caucus weeping in all white at the US-Mexico border. Though little was changed in practice, there was spectacle, outrage, momentum, and energy, a collective and righteous sense of empathy around the issue that took even longtime immigrant and refugee rights organizations by surprise.

The platforms that are the most prominent and widely consumed by the masses hereâ€”whether in print, TV, movies, or radio are tightly controlled by corporate monopolies that are themselves controlled by the global ruling class. For this reason, the messages that we are exposed to when we consume this media on a day to day basis represent, first and foremost, the interests and ideology of that ruling class. It doesnâ€™t matter the identity of the talking head, nor their stated politics, nor the branding of the media platform, the agenda is the same. Another important thing to understand is that for the most part the ruling class and the petit-bourgeois class that comprises the media, politicians, policy makers, public intellectuals, and other â€˜influencersâ€™ within the United Snakes were not in any way seriously opposed to Trump or his policies.

match : line -->In this example of nearly identical  draconian and inhumane approaches to immigration policy met with wildly different receptions from the masses, we can see both the strategy and the impact of capitalism-imperialismâ€™s weaponization of empathy. How, when we are not politically educated, our sense of care and concern for the conditions of other living beings can be manipulated and deployed at the whims of the ruling class using their massive media monopolies. Itâ€™s not that people stopped caring about kids being put in cages, families being separated, and infants being deported without caretakers, itâ€™s that our awareness of these issues is determined by the visibility the ruling class chooses to give them within the media we consume. They can turn that awareness off and turn it on and they can point it wherever they want to. This is why the spectacle around immigration stopped as soon as Biden entered office. This is also why even at the height of the outrage, mainstream media analysis of the cruelty of US immigration policy under Trump never got into the real reasons  why so many people were fleeing their homes for the US border. Doing so would have required implicating US imperialism and no one on TV was trying to do that.

We have been manipulated into believing that the attack on Ukraine began two weeks ago, out of nowhere, and that it was provoked by nothing more than the poor mental health of a broad orientalist stereotype disguised as a man. We believe we are weeping for the people of Ukraine, but really we are engaged in a false fight for their sovereignty alongside the forces who destroyed that sovereignty in the first place. Any attempt to analyze the historical and political context that led to this momentâ€” broken agreements not to expand NATO, the US-led attacks on Ukraineâ€™s self-determination, the US and NATOâ€™s long and uncomfortable history of knowingly colluding with fascists , is met with hostility and accusations of â€œapologismâ€. The call from the bourgeois propaganda apparatus is to stand with Ukraine and doing so means accepting that itâ€™s history begins when the New York Times and MSNBC say so. Because the masses of people in the US are largely unconscious, not politically educated, pretty racist, and systematically trained and bribed into aligning with white supremacy and imperialism, this works.

As stated in the beginning, empathy is an essential part of who we are collectively as human beings; an evolutionary gift meant to deepen our dependence upon each other and strengthen the social organization we need for survival. What we have to realize however, is that without consciousness and critical thinking skills developed through a process of political education (most effectively within the context of a revolutionary organization) our empathy can and will be manipulated and weaponized by the enemies of humanity to serve their interests. We have to understand that true identification and solidarity with the masses of human beings and other living things on this planet requires an actual understanding of their struggles and conditions with full context. We have to understand that emojis, hashtag campaigns, and slogans that tail the geopolitical interests of genocidal war mongering imperialists are a poor replacement for actual internationalism.

Most common plastics biodegrade very slowly, sometimes to the extent that they are considered non-biodegradable.[23][30] As polymers are ordinarily too large to be absorbed by microbes, biodegradation initially relies on secreted extracellular enzymes to reduce the polymers to manageable chain-lengths. This requires the polymers bare functional groups the enzymes can 'recognise', such as ester or amide groups. Long-chain polymers with all-carbon backbones like polyolefins, polystyrene and PVC will not degrade by biological action alone[31] and must first be oxidised to create chemical groups which the enzymes can attack.[32][33]

Even without displacing agriculture and cities, earth can sustain almost one billion hectares of new forests. This would remove 25% of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and reduce its concentration to levels that existed in the early 20th century. A temperature rise of 1.5 degrees would reduce the area suitable for forests by 20% by the year 2050, because some tropical areas will become too hot.[11] The countries that have the most forest-ready land are: Russia, Canada, Brazil, Australia, the United States and China.[12]

These payments are funded through international donations and nationwide taxes.[16]

This is because it substitutes a high-albedo, snow-dominated region with a lower-albedo forest canopy. By contrast, tropical reforestation projects lead to a positive change such as the formation of clouds. These clouds then reflect the sunlight, lowering temperatures.[9]:â€Š1457â€Š

Trees in tropical climates have, on average, larger, brighter, and more abundant leaves than non-tropical climates. A study of the girth of 70,000 trees across Africa has shown that tropical forests fix more carbon dioxide pollution than previously realized. The research suggested almost one fifth of fossil fuel emissions are absorbed by forests across Africa, Amazonia and Asia. Simon Lewis stated, "Tropical forest trees are absorbing about 18% of the carbon dioxide added to the atmosphere each year from burning fossil fuels, substantially buffering the rate of change."[18]

Streck and Scholz (2006) explain how a group of scientists from various institutions have developed a compensated reduction of deforestation approach which would reward developing countries that disrupt any further act of deforestation. Countries that participate and take the option to reduce their emissions from deforestation during a committed period of time would receive financial compensation for the carbon dioxide emissions that they avoided.[25]:â€Š875â€Š To raise the payments, the host country would issue government bonds or negotiate some kind of loan with a financial institution that would want to take part in the compensation promised to the other country. The funds received by the country could be invested to help find alternatives to the extensive cutdown of forests. This whole process of cutting emissions would be voluntary, but once the country has agreed to lower their emissions they would be obligated to reduce their emissions. However, if a country was not able to meet their obligation, their target would get added to their next commitment period. The authors of these proposals see this as a solely government-to-government agreement; private entities would not participate in the compensation trades.[25]:â€Š876â€Š

Opposition to Native American hunting and fishing persisted even though recreational hunting was permitted in 75 areas managed by the NPS and recreational fishing was extensively allowed and legislation establishing some National Parks contained provisions disclaiming any intention to affect reserved treaty rights. There has been a lengthy history of conflict between the managers of federal public lands and Native American hunting, fishing, land claims, sacred sites, water rights, religious freedom, concessions, and management. [iii] Not until the early 21st century and the new rule â€œGathering of Certain Plants or Plant Parts by Federally Recognized Indian Tribes for Traditional Purposesâ€ was the need to provide access and use of certain resources within National Parks acknowledged.[iv]

But in recent years, I have seen challenges to that paradigm, much of it due to a rapidly changing climate. I witness glaciers melting, species driven by climate appearing for the first time in parks, fires burning for a longer season, and storms ravaging coastal parks. I realized that attempting to hold our national parks in some sort of ecological stasis based on an interpretation of a pre-contact America was no longer possible and not even viable. We needed a new paradigm for the management of our natural and cultural resources that was reflective of these emerging challenges but also respectful of our history and basic mission to leave these parks â€˜unimpaired for future generations.

A 12-day spiritual caravan of Apache Stronghold activists and environmentalists journeyed from Arizona to San Francisco for the hearing, in the latest chapter of the 17-year battle to save Oak Flat, the historic Apache Stronghold, ChÃ­â€™chil BiÅ‚dagoteel. Oak Flat is threatened with destruction by Resolution Copper â€” owned by notorious mining barons Rio Tinto and BHP â€” and exploitation for copper mining and being turned into a 1,000-foot-deep, two-mile-long crater.

match : line -->In 1846, southern Arizona fell under the influence of the United States following the Mexican-American War. In 1848, gold was discovered in California and tens of thousands of ill prepared men streamed across America heading toward dreams of riches. One of the primary routes was across southern Arizona. Between 1849 and 1851, an estimated 60,000 travelers arrived among our peaceful people, many starving or near death from dehydration and/or wounds inflicted in battle by the warring Apache to the east and the Yuman tribes to the west of our lands. Here the travelers rested and ate well, enjoying our bounty of wheat, corn, beans, pumpkins, watermelon, squash, peas and other foods. Indeed, one grateful member of the Mormon Battalion wrote in his journal in I846, en route from New Mexico to California to secure that state during the Mexican American War, â€œThey are a noble race.â€ And wrote Lt. Sylvester Mowry in 1857, â€œTheir stores of wheat and corn have supplied many a starved emigrant, and restored his broken down animals.â€

Historically, the Akimel Oâ€™otham and Tohono Oâ€™odham were some of the worldâ€™s premier basketmakers, and the Tohono Oâ€™odham remain very active in this field. Among the Akimel Oâ€™otham, basket weaving is an art undergoing revival. In addition, culturual gatherings and special arts events are growing larger, and more tribal members are making a living, or supplementing their income, through the sale of arts and crafts. And, in January 2004, the community dedicated one of the nationâ€™s finest facilities for the preservation and display of Native artifacts, the Huhugam Heritage Center.

match : line -->In the early days of the Vietnam War, African-American service members represented less than five percent of personnel in the United States Navy.[1] The draft enticed men of all races to enlist in the Navy as a way to avoid heavy combat. This resulted in stiff competition, allowing Navy recruiters to enlist only the top performers on the Armed Forces Qualification Test. This was known as "Qualitative Recruitment"â€”recruiting the "highest quality" sailors, of whom nearly all happened to be white, as the quality of the education that white candidates had received was far superior to that of the black candidates. This made it improbable for black candidates to ever really compete with their white counterparts.[1]

The Navy recruitment quota fell by more than fifty percent from 1971 to 1972, which resulted in the Navy needing black men to achieve its recruitment goals.[1]

match : line -->By October 1972, the majority of the black enlisted sailors on the aircraft carrier Kitty Hawk had been serving for less than a year. Of approximately 4,500 sailors on the ship, less than seven percent were black.[1] Racial tensions were reportedly high on the ship. Politically, black sailors tended to support the advancement of social minorities in the Navy, views which conflicted with the obstacles they were faced with due to their lack of education. This created hostility on the ship and compounded the frustration the sailors felt from being at sea for nearly eight months.[1]

When he returned to Kitty Hawk, Horton told the other black sailors about what happened, which further agitated them.[6]
