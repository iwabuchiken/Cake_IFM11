In a recent Newsweek piece, Tom Oâ€™Connor confirms that â€œthe Syrian president has not only survived but appears poised to make a stunning comeback on the world stage.â€ Oâ€™Connor elaborates: â€œRecognizing reality, many of the countries that cut him [Assad] off 10 years ago have begun to welcome him back, despite ongoing US opposition to his rule. Telltale signs: Just last month, Jordan reopened its border with Syria, and the Arab League is widely expected to reinstate its membership shortly.â€

Though Moscow has played a major role in the conflict in Syria since the end of September 2015, its support has come at a price - one which suggests that its status has been less that of an ally and more that of putative imperial overlord. With this in mind, consider the words of former Russian diplomat, Alexander Aksenyonok, as quoted in May 2020 article by veteran Middle East correspondent Martin Jay from May: â€œIf Assad refuses to accept a new constitution, the Syrian regime will put itself at great risk.â€

match : line -->With the collapse of the PRGâ€™s socialist experiment, Grenada was thrown head first into the neoliberal era and a debt crisis, resulting in multiple rounds of structural adjustment that would eviscerate public spending and gut already-meagre social support networks. Similar to other Caribbean states, the government in Grenada is the predominant employer. When it was forced, through structural adjustment policies, to sell off public assets, structural, long term unemployment was the inevitable result. Emigration has since become characteristic of the island, as 71 percent of its secondary school and 85 percent of tertiary graduates have left the island. Not surprisingly the size of the Grenadian diaspora is estimated to be larger than the domestic population of 110,000 people.

match : line -->The Macron Doctrine, or the Paris Consensus, pledges to reverse those trends. To fight back against the ills of the financialised economy, Macron offers a three-pillar solution: more Europe, a true Europe-Africa partnership, and coalitions with governments and non-governmental players. Indeed, the Macron Doctrine is notionally post-colonial.  It calls for re-inventing the â€˜Afro-European Axisâ€™ and puts the onus on Europeans to â€˜show that this universalism we uphold is not universalism of the dominant, as it was during colonisation, but one of friends and partnersâ€™. If the Macron Doctrine for Europe is to make it â€˜the leading power in education, health, digital and green policiesâ€™ with massive investments, by extension it promises a post-financialisation, post-colonial partnership with Africa.

match : line -->For the last decade, the G20, the IMF, the World Bank and other multilateral development banks, (including the African Development Bank), and national development agencies (including the French Development Agency, the AFD) have pursued a new development agenda focused on a â€œgrand bargainâ€ with private finance: the Wall Street Consensus. Its logic is powerful. The global portfolio glut â€“ the trillions managed by institutional investors, mostly from the Global North â€“ could finance the Sustainable Development Goals, given the assumption of scarce public resources in the Global South. For instance, the World Bankâ€™s Maximising  Finance for Development agenda, introduced in 2017, promises institutional investors $12 trillion in market opportunities in the â€œWHITE sectorsâ€ â€“ Welfare, Health, Infrastructure, Transportation, Education. But institutional investors are governed by specific investment rules that need to be accommodated if they are to finance development. The urgent development question then becomes: how to â€˜escortâ€™ institutional investors (pension funds, insurance companies, investment funds) and their asset managers towards these opportunities?

This logic, neatly outlined by the Inter-American Development Bank, is echoed by all other multilateral development banks. It signals that the Wall Street Consensus is a project to reduce direct public investments in, and public delivery of services, and instead shift them to the private sector. The wrapping of the Washington Consensus privatisation agenda has changed, but the substance remains the same: citizens pay user fees for public services, now built and delivered via public-private partnerships (PPPs).

match : line -->When the state assumes demand risks, it guarantees PPP investors a pre-agreed level of revenue, regardless of actual demand for the public service. Examples abound. When Kenyaâ€™s President, Uhuru Kenyatta, visited Macron in October 2020, the local Kenyan newspapers reported  this as an official visit to conclude several PPP agreements in water, energy and transport. One of these PPPs, the Nairobi-Nakuru-Mau toll highway, will be constructed, financed and managed for 30 years by a consortium led by the French construction company Vinci and the French Asset Manager Meridiam fund. The Kenyan government guarantees â€˜availability of trafficâ€™ through a Toll Fund, approved by the Kenyan Parliament before Kenyattaâ€™s trip to France. The Toll Fund compensates the private French consortium should Kenyan citizens and firms fail to generate sufficient toll revenue. Kenyans pay, either directly through the toll tax, or indirectly through taxes, via the Toll Fund. The Toll Fund is a fiscal instrument for â€˜deriskingâ€™ French investments in Kenyan infrastructure.

Take the French asset manager Meridiam, one of the first  Strategic Partners of the General Secretary for the 2020 Africa-France Summit (postponed to next year due to the pandemic). Its Meridiam Infrastructure Africa fund, with over EUR 500 million in assets, includes a hospital in Ivory Coast, toll highways in Kenya, and renewable energy projects in Senegal, Ethiopia, Nigeria and Ivory Coast, run as PPP projects. Its CEO, Thierry Deau, recently applauded  a â€˜major cultural shift towards a broader derisking philosophyâ€™ to achieve the UN Sustainable Development Goals, and noted that the success of its Africa infrastructure fund in part reflected its ability to create strategic partnerships with African governments so that : â€œwe benefit in the contract with the authorities from a strong currency risk protection reinforced by a political risk insurance coverage in case the government does not meet its commitment.  Eventually, this provides a very robust protection.â€

match : line -->Empathy, the ability to understand and share the feelings of other beings, is present in some form in most living things on Earth. Scientists theorize that empathy developed as an evolutionary strategy to build stronger bonds among animals that depend on cooperation for survival. In one particular kind of animal, humans, empathy is clear evidence that the claim spread by the ruling class, that each of us is fundamentally cruel, self-interested, and greedy is nothing more than an attempt to naturalize the individualism and antisocial behavior that best serves their exploitative interests. In its purest form empathy is a net positive for us on a planet where for the last several hundred years the genocidal system of capitalism-imperialism has normalized massive daily violence happening against a backdrop of apathy and ignorance. Empathyâ€™s endurance among us says that a better and more just way of living is possible despite our current conditions and that the (re)building of that way of living is within our capacity. However, empathy, like almost every aspect of the psyche when we are disorganized and unconscious, can be weaponized and manipulated by that same genocidal global system. We are witnessing this today on a grand scale.

Masses of people outside of the so-called â€œLeftâ€, people who had never understood themselves to be activists or particularly interested in social justice at all, were motivated to mobilize and take action to protest what they correctly understood as openly cruel policies and practices. We saw massive demonstrations at airports halting deportation flights, impassioned monologues from late night talk show hosts, breathless media coverage, undercover exposÃ©s, presidential candidates denouncing â€˜kids in cagesâ€™, and members of the progressive Democratic caucus weeping in all white at the US-Mexico border. Though little was changed in practice, there was spectacle, outrage, momentum, and energy, a collective and righteous sense of empathy around the issue that took even longtime immigrant and refugee rights organizations by surprise.

The platforms that are the most prominent and widely consumed by the masses hereâ€”whether in print, TV, movies, or radio are tightly controlled by corporate monopolies that are themselves controlled by the global ruling class. For this reason, the messages that we are exposed to when we consume this media on a day to day basis represent, first and foremost, the interests and ideology of that ruling class. It doesnâ€™t matter the identity of the talking head, nor their stated politics, nor the branding of the media platform, the agenda is the same. Another important thing to understand is that for the most part the ruling class and the petit-bourgeois class that comprises the media, politicians, policy makers, public intellectuals, and other â€˜influencersâ€™ within the United Snakes were not in any way seriously opposed to Trump or his policies.

match : line -->In this example of nearly identical  draconian and inhumane approaches to immigration policy met with wildly different receptions from the masses, we can see both the strategy and the impact of capitalism-imperialismâ€™s weaponization of empathy. How, when we are not politically educated, our sense of care and concern for the conditions of other living beings can be manipulated and deployed at the whims of the ruling class using their massive media monopolies. Itâ€™s not that people stopped caring about kids being put in cages, families being separated, and infants being deported without caretakers, itâ€™s that our awareness of these issues is determined by the visibility the ruling class chooses to give them within the media we consume. They can turn that awareness off and turn it on and they can point it wherever they want to. This is why the spectacle around immigration stopped as soon as Biden entered office. This is also why even at the height of the outrage, mainstream media analysis of the cruelty of US immigration policy under Trump never got into the real reasons  why so many people were fleeing their homes for the US border. Doing so would have required implicating US imperialism and no one on TV was trying to do that.
