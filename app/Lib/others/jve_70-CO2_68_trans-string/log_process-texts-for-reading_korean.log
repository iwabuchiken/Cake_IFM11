In a recent Newsweek piece, Tom Oâ€™Connor confirms that â€œthe Syrian president has not only survived but appears poised to make a stunning comeback on the world stage.â€ Oâ€™Connor elaborates: â€œRecognizing reality, many of the countries that cut him [Assad] off 10 years ago have begun to welcome him back, despite ongoing US opposition to his rule. Telltale signs: Just last month, Jordan reopened its border with Syria, and the Arab League is widely expected to reinstate its membership shortly.â€

Though Moscow has played a major role in the conflict in Syria since the end of September 2015, its support has come at a price - one which suggests that its status has been less that of an ally and more that of putative imperial overlord. With this in mind, consider the words of former Russian diplomat, Alexander Aksenyonok, as quoted in May 2020 article by veteran Middle East correspondent Martin Jay from May: â€œIf Assad refuses to accept a new constitution, the Syrian regime will put itself at great risk.â€

match : line -->With the collapse of the PRGâ€™s socialist experiment, Grenada was thrown head first into the neoliberal era and a debt crisis, resulting in multiple rounds of structural adjustment that would eviscerate public spending and gut already-meagre social support networks. Similar to other Caribbean states, the government in Grenada is the predominant employer. When it was forced, through structural adjustment policies, to sell off public assets, structural, long term unemployment was the inevitable result. Emigration has since become characteristic of the island, as 71 percent of its secondary school and 85 percent of tertiary graduates have left the island. Not surprisingly the size of the Grenadian diaspora is estimated to be larger than the domestic population of 110,000 people.
