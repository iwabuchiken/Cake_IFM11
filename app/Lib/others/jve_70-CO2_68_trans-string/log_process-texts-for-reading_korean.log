In a recent Newsweek piece, Tom Oâ€™Connor confirms that â€œthe Syrian president has not only survived but appears poised to make a stunning comeback on the world stage.â€ Oâ€™Connor elaborates: â€œRecognizing reality, many of the countries that cut him [Assad] off 10 years ago have begun to welcome him back, despite ongoing US opposition to his rule. Telltale signs: Just last month, Jordan reopened its border with Syria, and the Arab League is widely expected to reinstate its membership shortly.â€

Though Moscow has played a major role in the conflict in Syria since the end of September 2015, its support has come at a price - one which suggests that its status has been less that of an ally and more that of putative imperial overlord. With this in mind, consider the words of former Russian diplomat, Alexander Aksenyonok, as quoted in May 2020 article by veteran Middle East correspondent Martin Jay from May: â€œIf Assad refuses to accept a new constitution, the Syrian regime will put itself at great risk.â€

match : line -->With the collapse of the PRGâ€™s socialist experiment, Grenada was thrown head first into the neoliberal era and a debt crisis, resulting in multiple rounds of structural adjustment that would eviscerate public spending and gut already-meagre social support networks. Similar to other Caribbean states, the government in Grenada is the predominant employer. When it was forced, through structural adjustment policies, to sell off public assets, structural, long term unemployment was the inevitable result. Emigration has since become characteristic of the island, as 71 percent of its secondary school and 85 percent of tertiary graduates have left the island. Not surprisingly the size of the Grenadian diaspora is estimated to be larger than the domestic population of 110,000 people.

match : line -->The Macron Doctrine, or the Paris Consensus, pledges to reverse those trends. To fight back against the ills of the financialised economy, Macron offers a three-pillar solution: more Europe, a true Europe-Africa partnership, and coalitions with governments and non-governmental players. Indeed, the Macron Doctrine is notionally post-colonial.  It calls for re-inventing the â€˜Afro-European Axisâ€™ and puts the onus on Europeans to â€˜show that this universalism we uphold is not universalism of the dominant, as it was during colonisation, but one of friends and partnersâ€™. If the Macron Doctrine for Europe is to make it â€˜the leading power in education, health, digital and green policiesâ€™ with massive investments, by extension it promises a post-financialisation, post-colonial partnership with Africa.

match : line -->For the last decade, the G20, the IMF, the World Bank and other multilateral development banks, (including the African Development Bank), and national development agencies (including the French Development Agency, the AFD) have pursued a new development agenda focused on a â€œgrand bargainâ€ with private finance: the Wall Street Consensus. Its logic is powerful. The global portfolio glut â€“ the trillions managed by institutional investors, mostly from the Global North â€“ could finance the Sustainable Development Goals, given the assumption of scarce public resources in the Global South. For instance, the World Bankâ€™s Maximising  Finance for Development agenda, introduced in 2017, promises institutional investors $12 trillion in market opportunities in the â€œWHITE sectorsâ€ â€“ Welfare, Health, Infrastructure, Transportation, Education. But institutional investors are governed by specific investment rules that need to be accommodated if they are to finance development. The urgent development question then becomes: how to â€˜escortâ€™ institutional investors (pension funds, insurance companies, investment funds) and their asset managers towards these opportunities?

This logic, neatly outlined by the Inter-American Development Bank, is echoed by all other multilateral development banks. It signals that the Wall Street Consensus is a project to reduce direct public investments in, and public delivery of services, and instead shift them to the private sector. The wrapping of the Washington Consensus privatisation agenda has changed, but the substance remains the same: citizens pay user fees for public services, now built and delivered via public-private partnerships (PPPs).

match : line -->When the state assumes demand risks, it guarantees PPP investors a pre-agreed level of revenue, regardless of actual demand for the public service. Examples abound. When Kenyaâ€™s President, Uhuru Kenyatta, visited Macron in October 2020, the local Kenyan newspapers reported  this as an official visit to conclude several PPP agreements in water, energy and transport. One of these PPPs, the Nairobi-Nakuru-Mau toll highway, will be constructed, financed and managed for 30 years by a consortium led by the French construction company Vinci and the French Asset Manager Meridiam fund. The Kenyan government guarantees â€˜availability of trafficâ€™ through a Toll Fund, approved by the Kenyan Parliament before Kenyattaâ€™s trip to France. The Toll Fund compensates the private French consortium should Kenyan citizens and firms fail to generate sufficient toll revenue. Kenyans pay, either directly through the toll tax, or indirectly through taxes, via the Toll Fund. The Toll Fund is a fiscal instrument for â€˜deriskingâ€™ French investments in Kenyan infrastructure.

Take the French asset manager Meridiam, one of the first  Strategic Partners of the General Secretary for the 2020 Africa-France Summit (postponed to next year due to the pandemic). Its Meridiam Infrastructure Africa fund, with over EUR 500 million in assets, includes a hospital in Ivory Coast, toll highways in Kenya, and renewable energy projects in Senegal, Ethiopia, Nigeria and Ivory Coast, run as PPP projects. Its CEO, Thierry Deau, recently applauded  a â€˜major cultural shift towards a broader derisking philosophyâ€™ to achieve the UN Sustainable Development Goals, and noted that the success of its Africa infrastructure fund in part reflected its ability to create strategic partnerships with African governments so that : â€œwe benefit in the contract with the authorities from a strong currency risk protection reinforced by a political risk insurance coverage in case the government does not meet its commitment.  Eventually, this provides a very robust protection.â€
